# TASKS.md


- [x] 2026-02-09 - Analyze existing markdown docs and `suwayomi_manga_daemon.sh`, then finalize implementation requirements for the C# port.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Update documentation to reflect agreed C# port requirements and architecture decisions.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Bootstrap solution structure for implementation (`net9.0`, warnings-as-errors, core project folders, test projects, shared test utilities). DoD: `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` succeed; warnings are treated as errors; test projects and shared test helpers are wired into the solution.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Create repository `.editorconfig` for AGENTS formatting standards (Allman braces, naming rules, XMLDOC expectations).
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Define YAML schemas for `settings.yml`, `manga_equivalents.yml`, `scene_tags.yml`, and `source_priority.yml` and document validation rules. DoD: concrete schema types exist in code and docs; invalid/missing fields produce deterministic validation errors.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement config bootstrap and migration: if YAML is missing, import legacy `.txt` files and write canonical YAML files. DoD: first-run migration path is implemented and tested for expected, edge, and malformed input cases.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement settings self-healing so missing settings keys are added with defaults and persisted back to `settings.yml`. DoD: loading older/incomplete `settings.yml` auto-populates new keys and writes updated file without deleting existing valid values.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Strengthen bootstrap/settings parser unit tests to cover expected, edge, and exception guard paths across new self-healing code.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Harden configuration unit tests across bootstrap/loading/validation files with expected, edge, and exception coverage per function, plus targeted property-based and mutation-test scaffolding.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement config directory logging subsystem (structured, relevant messages, rolling/retention policy as configured). DoD: logs write under config path, include key operational events, and honor configured retention/rotation behavior.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Centralize logging level parsing so settings validation and logger creation share one canonical implementation.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Address PR feedback on log-level parser semantics and token-source drift (non-throwing TryParse + single-source supported token list).
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Harden logging file-path safety by rejecting rooted/traversal `logging.file_name` values in validation and enforcing resolved path containment under `paths.log_root_path`.
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Improve XML documentation comments for public configuration validation APIs touched by recent logging/validation changes.
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Expand XML documentation coverage in `SettingsDocumentValidator` to include all members and helper methods used by settings validation.
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Improve XML documentation coverage across logging, hosting, bootstrap, and settings-document types touched in the active feature branch.
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Improve XML documentation comments for all identifiers in modified configuration bootstrap/document/loading/validation files to provide self-contained usage guidance.
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Harden `logging.file_name` validation to reject cross-platform invalid characters, trailing dot/space, and Windows reserved device names at config-validation time.
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Harden `RollingFileLogger` so `LogLevel.None` is always treated as non-emitting sentinel and cannot be logged as an event level.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Fix cross-platform logging.file_name validation drift by rejecting reserved Windows device names deterministically on all OSes and updating unit tests.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement scene-tag service with default `scene_tags.yml` generation and data-driven tag matching. DoD: missing file is created with defaults; matching behavior is driven exclusively by YAML entries; no hardcoded tag list remains in runtime logic.
- [ ] 2026-02-09 - Implement title normalization engine per docs (ASCII fold, punctuation strip, leading-article strip, trailing-`s` singularization, cached compare keys). DoD: normalization rules match documented order and are covered by unit tests for expected, edge, and failure cases.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement equivalence and source-priority services using YAML-backed data models. DoD: canonical title mapping and source ordering are loaded from YAML and exercised by unit tests for precedence, fallback, and invalid entries.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Add resolution-service regression tests for null guard clauses and unknown lookup out-parameter contracts across equivalence, source-priority, and override resolvers.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Decouple title-key normalization from configuration validation by introducing `TitleKeyNormalizer` in domain and wiring resolution plus validation adapter call sites to it.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Address PR review feedback by removing avoidable title-normalization array allocations, correcting resolver XML-doc performance wording, and freezing resolver lookup dictionaries.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement source/override volume discovery for container layout (treat direct children of `/ssm/sources` and `/ssm/override` as mapped volumes). DoD: discovery returns correct direct-child volumes only, with tests for empty dirs, mixed files, and nested paths.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Improve semantic-feature unit tests for scene-tag matcher, title normalization, equivalence validation, and bootstrap cross-document validation with expected/edge/exception coverage.

- [x] 2026-02-12 - Add title-fixture regression tests for scene-tag stripping outcomes and adjust default scene tags (`all chapters` added, `valir scans` removed) to match expected behavior.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Decouple shared comparison/token normalization from configuration validation by introducing domain-level normalization primitives consumed by scene-tag matching and validators.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement command execution abstraction for external Linux tools (`mergerfs`, `findmnt`, `fusermount*`, `inotifywait`) with timeout and error handling. DoD: command runner supports timeout, cancellation, stderr/stdout capture, and typed failure handling with test coverage.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Refactor `ExternalCommandExecutor` output capture to task-based readers and fix boundary race classification so process exit wins over timeout/cancellation at handoff boundaries.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Address PR #7 process-executor review comments by adding final boundary exit rechecks, field-specific validation `ParamName` diagnostics, traced non-fatal capture-completion exception handling, and CTS-disposal plus diagnostic assertions in tests.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement mount-state snapshot and reconciliation service (desired mounts vs actual mounts, remount decisions, stale cleanup). DoD: reconciliation computes mount/unmount/remount actions deterministically and safely handles stale entries in tested scenarios.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Fix mountpoint reconciliation key drift by normalizing desired/actual/forced/stale mountpoint matching (slash/trailing-separator variants) and add regression tests.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Fix findmnt `-P` escaped-backslash quote termination parsing drift and add parser/service regression tests.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Harden mount parser/reconciliation contracts: non-throwing `TryParse` blank handling, unknown-escape preservation, normalized ordering keys, and regression coverage.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Address PR review feedback by using compatible `findmnt` pair-mode flags (`-n -P`) and applying minor reconciliation style cleanup.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Audit legacy shell `findmnt -rn -P` usages in `suwayomi_manga_daemon.sh` for util-linux compatibility and decide migration approach.
- [x] 2026-02-13 - Address PR #11 reviewer feedback by adding timed `findmnt` pair-mode wrapper dispatching to external `findmnt` (not shell functions) under `ro_timeout`.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement branch-link preparation and override branch selection logic (preferred write branch + additional RW override branches + RO source branches). DoD: generated branch order and RW/RO flags match requirements and are validated by integration-style tests.
- [x] 2026-02-12 - Expand cross-platform branch-planning coverage and harden path handling (Windows case-variant path dedupe, separator-safe title/link validation).

- [x] 2026-02-13 - Address branch-planning review notes: align path ordering/dedupe semantics, centralize path validation helpers, harden mode-token mapping and sanitize buffer strategy, and expand regression tests.
- [x] 2026-02-13 - Follow up branch-planning review notes by fixing candidate-path `ParamName` attribution and making override-volume case-variant representative selection deterministic across input permutations.
- [x] 2026-02-13 - Tighten branch-link name validation with deterministic cross-platform invalid-character/trailing-dot-space guards, remove unreachable planner guards, and clarify path-safety parameter semantics.

- [x] 2026-02-14 - Harden rename queue transform atomicity so invalid/throwing transformers do not partially mutate queue state; add regression coverage for null-entry and throwing-transform callbacks.
- [x] 2026-02-14 - Complete rename follow-up refactors: centralize sanitizer token sets with embedded `ch./ep.` support, extract queue-pass processing helpers, add concurrent ProcessOnce and rescan duplicate-skip regressions, and document shell traceability.
- [x] 2026-02-14 - Address PR #12 rename review follow-up: make queue ordering explicit (no dictionary-order reliance), propagate non-benign filesystem enumeration faults, add quiet-check early exit, and document intentional transform lock-scope parity behavior.
- [x] 2026-02-14 - Refine rename enumeration/error boundary: keep filesystem adapter lazy, materialize at processor safe wrappers with benign directory-not-found suppression, and micro-optimize quiet-check timestamp branching.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement filesystem event watcher and trigger pipeline (inotify + periodic rescans + deduped scan requests). DoD: watcher reacts to relevant events, periodic fallback works, and duplicate scans are coalesced under load in integration tests.
- [x] 2026-02-14 - Harden watcher trigger pipeline behavior: enforce hard-stop cancellation checkpoints, dispatch coalesced merge requests outside lock with recoverable exception mapping, perform immediate source/manga recursive rename enqueue, parse inotify lines with last-delimiter semantics, and skip missing watch roots with warnings.
- [x] 2026-02-14 - Address PR #13 watcher-coalescer review follow-up by changing merge request force semantics to latest-request-wins and updating coalescer coverage/docs index wording.
- [x] 2026-02-09 - Implement daemon supervisor lifecycle (startup, health, lock/PID handling, graceful stop/cleanup). DoD: start/stop lifecycle is idempotent, lock behavior prevents duplicate supervisors, and cleanup paths are tested for normal and interrupted shutdown.

- [x] 2026-02-14 - Address PR #14 AI reviewer follow-up by mapping daemon startup exceptions in `RunAsync` to deterministic exit codes, removing redundant supervisor startup `Task.Run` layering, tightening `StartAsync` cancellation XML docs, and adding startup failure/cancellation regression coverage.
- [ ] 2026-02-09 - Implement end-to-end integration tests (Docker-based, real filesystem scenarios, tool-command mocks/fakes where needed). DoD: CI-runnable integration suite verifies core workflows and failure recovery paths in a Linux container environment.
- [ ] 2026-02-09 - Add container/runtime assets (Dockerfile, entrypoint, required package dependencies, volume and permission expectations). DoD: container builds successfully, starts with documented mounts/permissions, and runs the daemon end-to-end in test environment.
- [ ] 2026-02-09 - Finalize docs and developer index after implementation (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT_INDEX.yml`, migration notes, operation guide). DoD: docs match shipped behavior, migration path is documented, and `AGENT_INDEX.yml` is updated per `AGENT_INDEX_PROMPT.md`.
