# Configuration

Configuration models, defaults, YAML parsing, and deterministic validation logic live here.

- `Documents/`: strongly typed schema models and default document factories.
- `Loading/`: YAML parser and parse-and-validate pipeline services.
- `Validation/`: validators, stable error codes, and normalization helpers.
