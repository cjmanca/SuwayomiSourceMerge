# Infrastructure

Filesystem, process execution, and platform integration services.

- `Processes/`: external command execution abstractions with bounded stdout/stderr capture and typed outcomes.
- `Volumes/`: container volume discovery services and filesystem adapters.
- `Logging/`: structured runtime logging formatters, sinks, and logger factories.
